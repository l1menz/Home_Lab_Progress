Daily updates and documentation of the setup and development of my homelab

30/1/25

**Summary:**
- Researched and developed initial plan of what hardware I will use for my homelab
- Outlined purpose of homelab and what to expect from it

Most of today was used to find multiple youtube videos to take inspiration from and understand the purpose of a homelab. For now I've set up a rasperry pi 3, which will most likely act as the server of the lab.
